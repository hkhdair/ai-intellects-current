                                <p>Automation, data analytics, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are among the top
                                    applications of AI. But what do these terms truly mean, and how can they simplify
                                    processes
                                    and boost operational efficiency?</p>

                                <h3>AI Automation</h3>
                                <p>AI is rescuing us from the monotonous grind of repetitive tasks. Teams are no longer
                                    shackled
                                    by hours of mindless work, and employees can now channel their energy into

                                    40-60%.
                                    The numbers speak volumes, making AI an imperative consideration for businesses
