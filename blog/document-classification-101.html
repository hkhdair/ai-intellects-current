                        <p>Document classification is the process of categorizing documents into relevant groups, making
                            them easier to manage and analyze. It's the digital librarian of the data world, ensuring
                            that every document finds its home. Document classification isn't merely about convenience;
                            it's about saving valuable time and resources.</p>

                        <h3>Text vs. Image Classification</h3>

                        <p>Documents come in all shapes and sizes, often containing text, images, or both. Document
                            classification branches into text and image classification.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Text Classification:</strong> This sub-task focuses exclusively on text, whether
                                it's a sentence, paragraph, or an entire document. It employs Natural Language
                                Processing to understand text-based content, making it ideal for textual data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Image Classification:</strong> On the other hand, image classification deals
                                with visual documents. Utilizing Computer Vision, object recognition, and image
                                recognition technologies, it assigns images to specific categories based on visual
                                attributes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Types of Automatic Document Classification</h3>

                            the three primary approaches being:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Supervised Document Classification:</strong> This method relies on a labeled
                                training dataset to accurately predict the category of new documents. It is generally
                                more accurate but necessitates a labeled dataset, which can be time-consuming and
                                expensive to create.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unsupervised Document Classification:</strong> Unsupervised methods classify
                                documents by analyzing the inherent differences between them. While they don't require
                                labeled data, their accuracy may be lower, and evaluation can be challenging.</li>
                            <li><strong>Semi-Supervised Document Classification:</strong> This method combines elements
                                of both supervised and unsupervised techniques, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled
                                data. It offers an accuracy boost over unsupervised methods but can be more complex to
                                implement.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>How Does Document Classification Work?</h2>

                        <p>At the core of document classification is the process of gathering, training, and evaluating.
                            It's the blueprint for creating a system that can automatically categorize documents.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Gather a Dataset:</strong> The journey begins with assembling a dataset, which
                                should be sufficiently large for training the classification model. More data leads to
                                better results.</li>
                            <li><strong>Train the Model:</strong> The chosen dataset becomes the training ground for the
                                model. This process can be time-consuming, depending on the method used. Training can be
                                supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised, based on the resources available.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluate Results:</strong> Benchmarking the results is crucial to ensure that
                                the model aligns with your expectations. Assigning a predicted document to a human
                                reviewer can validate the accuracy of the model's predictions.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Document classification might sound complex, but with the right tools and understanding, it's
